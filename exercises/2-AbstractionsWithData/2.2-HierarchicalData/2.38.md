## Question
The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right` (combine the first element with the result of combining all elements to the right)

```clojure
(define (fold-right operation initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
    initial
    (operation (car sequence)
               (fold-right operation initial (cdr sequence)))))
```

There's also a `fold-left` (combine elements working in the opposite direction)

```clojure
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
      result
      (iter (op result (car rest))
            (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of

```clojure
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that
`fold-right` and `fold-left` will produce the same values
for any sequence

## Answer

**1. Evaluation results**
```clojure
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(/ 1 (fold-right / 1 (list 2 3)))
(/ 1 (/ 2 (fold-right / 1 (list 3))))
(/ 1 (/ 2 (/ 3 (fold-right / 1 nil))))
(/ 1 (/ 2 (/ 3 1)))
;; => 3/2

(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(iter (/ 1 1) (list 2 3))
(iter 1 (list 2 3))
(iter (/ 1 2) (list 3))
(iter 0.5 (list 3))
(iter (/ 0.5 3) nil)
;; => 1/6

(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(list 1 (fold-right list nil (list 2 3)))
(list 1 (list 2 (fold-right list nil (list 3))))
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 (fold-right list nil nil))))
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 nil)))
;; => (1 (2 (3 ())))

(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
(iter nil (list 1 2 3))
(iter (list nil 1) (list 2 3))
(iter (list (list nil 1) 2) (list 3))
(iter (list (list (list nil 1) 2) 3) nil)
;; => (((() 1) 2) 3)
```

**2. Property of 'op' for 2 procedures to produce the same value**
- 'op' must have associative property
- example: addition, multiplication
