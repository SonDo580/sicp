## Question

Give combinations of cars and cdrs that will pick 7 from each of the following lists:

```
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
```

## Answer

1. (1 3 (5 7) 9)

```
(cdr (car (cdr (cdr x))))
```

**Explain:**

```
(cdr (1 3 (5 7) 9)) -> (3 (5 7) 9)
(cdr (3 (5 7) 9)) -> ((5 7) 9)
(car ((5 7) 9)) -> (5 7)
(cdr (5 7)) -> 7
```

2. ((7))

```
(car (car x))
```

**Explain:**

```
(car ((7))) -> (7)
(car (7)) -> 7
```

3. (1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))

```
(car (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr x)))))))
```

**Explain:**

```
(cdr (1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))) -> (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))
(cdr (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))) -> (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))
(cdr (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))) -> (4 (5 (6 7)))
(cdr (4 (5 (6 7)))) -> (5 (6 7))
(cdr (5 (6 7))) -> (6 7)
(cdr (6 7)) -> (7)
(car (7)) -> 7
```
