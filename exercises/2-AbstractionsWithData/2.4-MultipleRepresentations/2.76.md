## Question

As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed.

For each of the 3 strategies — generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing style — describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations.

Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

## Answer
1. **Changes that must be made to add new types**
- data-directed style: add new columns (install a new package)
- dispatching on type: add case for the type in each operation
- message-passing style: just define the new constructor

2. **Changes that must be made to add new operations**
- data-directed style: add new rows (add and publish the procudure in each package, define a new generic selector)
- dispatching on type: just define the new operation
- message-passing style: add case for the new operation in the data object

3. **Use cases**
- Use message-passing style when types must be added often
- Use dispatching on type when operations must be added often
