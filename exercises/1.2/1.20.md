## Question

```scheme
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
    a
    (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation. Using the substitution method, illustrate the process generated in evaluating `(gcd 206 40)` and indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed. How many remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)`? In the applicative-order evaluation?

## Answer

1. **The process generated using normal-order evaluation**

```scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(if (= 40 0)
    206
    (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)))
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(if (= (remainder 206 40) 0)
    40
    (gcd (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
...
```

2. **The process generated using applicative-order evaluation**

```scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)
2
```
