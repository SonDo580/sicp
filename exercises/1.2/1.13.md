## Question

Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to $ϕ^n / \sqrt5$, where $ϕ = (1 + \sqrt5)/2$.
Hint: Let $ψ = (1 − \sqrt5)/2$. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers to prove that $Fib(n) = (ϕ^n − ψ^n)/\sqrt5$.

## Proof

- Prove the base case: n = 0 and n = 1
- Assume that the formula is correct for fib(k) and fib(k+1)
- Fibonacci numbers definition: fib(k+2) = fib(k+1) + fib(k)
- Prove that the formula is correct for fib(k+2)
- Use the formular, prove that $|fib(n) - ϕ^n / \sqrt5| < 1/2$
