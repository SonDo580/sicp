## Question:

Illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these procedures iterative or recursive?

```
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

```
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

## Answer:

1. **Process 1**

```
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
(inc 8)
9
```

=> This process is recursive

2. **Process 2**

```
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 6))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

=> This process is iterative
