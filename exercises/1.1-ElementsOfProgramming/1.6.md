## Question:

- Defines a new version of `if`

```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

- What happen when we use `new-if` to compute square root (example 1.1)

```
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
  guess
  (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

## Answer:

- The general form of an `if` expression is

```
(if ⟨predicate⟩ ⟨consequent⟩ ⟨alternative⟩)
```

- To evaluate an `if` expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the `predicate`. If the `predicate` evaluates to `true`, the interpreter then evaluates the `consequent` and returns its value. Otherwise it evaluates the `alternative` and returns its value.

- The `new-if` uses applicative-order evaluation - the interpreter evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments. This results in an infinite loop because of the else-clause in `sqrt-iter`.
