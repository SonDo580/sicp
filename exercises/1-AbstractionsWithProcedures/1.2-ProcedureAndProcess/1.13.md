## Question

Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to ϕ^n / sqrt(5), where ϕ = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
Hint: Let ψ = (1 − sqrt(5)) / 2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers to prove that Fib(n) = (ϕ^n − ψ^n) / sqrt(5).

## Proof

1. Prove that Fib(n) = (ϕ^n − ψ^n) / sqrt(5)
- Prove the base case: n = 0 and n = 1
- Fibonacci numbers definition: fib(k+2) = fib(k+1) + fib(k)
- Assume that the formula is correct for fib(k) and fib(k+1)
- Prove that the formula is correct for fib(k+2)

2. Using the formula, prove that |fib(n) - ϕ^n / sqrt(5)| < 1/2
