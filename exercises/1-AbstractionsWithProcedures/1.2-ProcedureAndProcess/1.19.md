## Question

There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables `a` and `b` in the `fib-iter` process of Section 1.2.2: `a ← a + b` and `b ← a`. Call this transformation `T`, and observe that applying `T` over and over again `n` times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair `Fib(n + 1)` and `Fib(n)`. In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying `T`<sup>`n`</sup>, the nth power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1, 0). Now consider T to be the special case of `p = 0` and `q = 1` in a family of transformations `T`<sub>`pq`</sub>, where `T`<sub>`pq`</sub> transforms the pair `(a, b)` according to `a ← bq + aq + ap` and `b ← bp + aq`. Show that if we apply such a transformation `T`<sub>`pq`</sub> twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation `T`<sub>`p'q'`</sub> of the same form, and compute `p'` and `q'` in terms of `p` and `q`. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute `T`<sup>`n`</sup> using successive squaring, as in the `fast-expt` procedure. Put this all together to complete a procedure, which runs in a logarithmic
number of steps.
