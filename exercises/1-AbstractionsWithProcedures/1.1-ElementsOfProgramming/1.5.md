## Problem

Determine whether the interpreter is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation

## Method

Use the following procedures:

```
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

Then evaluate the expression:

```
(test 0 (p))
```

## Question

What is the behavior when the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation / normal-order evaluation?

## Answer

1. Applicative-order evaluation:

- The interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments
- In this case: When evaluating (p), it will go into an infinite loop. Thus the expression (test 0 (p)) never terminates.

2. Normal-order evaluation:

- The operands will not be evaluated until their values are needed.
- The interpreter will substitute the arguments into the procedure body until it obtains an expression involving only primitive operators, then perform the evaluation.
- In this case: The expression will evaluate to 0 because the condition (= x 0) is satisfied.
