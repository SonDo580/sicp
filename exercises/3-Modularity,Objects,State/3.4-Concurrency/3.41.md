## Question:

```clojure
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
      (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
             balance)
      "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((protected (make-serializer)))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) (protected withdraw))
            ((eq? m 'deposit) (protected deposit))
            ((eq? m 'balance)
             ((protected (lambda () balance))) ; serialized
            (else (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
    dispatch)))
```

"Allowing un-serialized access to the bank balance can result in anomalous behavior." Do you agree? Is there any scenario that demonstrates that.

## Answer:
- The statement is wrong. It is unnecessary to serialize access to the bank balance.
- Assume that a change is being made to the bank account (withdraw or deposit). If we serialize reading the balance, the value will be before or after the change. But we get the same result if we don't serialize it.
