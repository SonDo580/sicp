## Question:

Give all possible values of x that can result from executing:

```clojure
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
```

Which of these possibilities remain if we instead use serialized procedures:

```clojure
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))
```

## Answer:

1. **Without serializer:**

- 10^6: P1 sets x to 10^2, then P2 sets x to (10^2)^3
- 10^6: P2 sets x to 10^3, then P1 sets x to (10^3)^2
- 10^2: P1 accesses x, then P2 sets x to 10^3, then P1 sets x to 10^2
- 10^3: P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 10^2, then P2 sets x to 10^3
- 10^4: P2 changes x from 10 to 10^3 between the 2 times that P1 evaluate (\* x x)
- 10^5: P1 changes x from 10 to 10^2 after P2 evaluates the first x -> (\* 10 10^2 10^2)
- 10^4: P1 changes x from 10 to 10^2 after P2 evaluates the second x - (\* 10 10 10^2)

2. **With serializer:**

- 10^6: P1 sets x to 10^2, then P2 sets x to (10^2)^3
- 10^6: P2 sets x to 10^3, then P1 sets x to (10^3)^2
