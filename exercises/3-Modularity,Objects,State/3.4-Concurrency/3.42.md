## Question:

```clojure
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
      (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
             balance)
      "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((protected (make-serializer)))
    (let ((protected-withdraw (protected withdraw))
          (protected-deposit (protected deposit)))
      (define (dispatch m)
        (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) protected-withdraw)
              ((eq? m 'deposit) protected-deposit)
              ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
              (else
               (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                      m))))
      dispatch)))
```

Instead of creating new serialized procedure in response to every `withdraw` and `deposit` message, returns the same serialized procedures when the account was created.

Is this a safe change to make?

## Answer:
- This is a safe change. Each account still has a unique serializer, and the `deposit` and `withdraw` procedures returned are always in the same set.
