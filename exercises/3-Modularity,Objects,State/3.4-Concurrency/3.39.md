## Question

```clojure
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute
    (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
    (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))
```

After the execution is complete, x will be in 5 possible values, depends on the interleaving of P1 and P2.

- 101: P1 sets x to 100, then P2 increments x to 101.
- 121: P2 increments x to 11, then P1 sets x to (\* x x)
- 110: P2 changes x from 10 to 11 between the 2 times that
-      P1 accesses x during the evaluation of (* x x)
- 11: P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, set P2 sets x
- 100: P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P1 sets x

Which of the 5 possibilities in the parallel execution shown above remain if we instead serialize execution as follows:

```clojure
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute
    (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
    (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
```

## Answer

3 cases are still possible:

- 101: P1 sets x to 100, then P2 increments x to 101.
- 121: P2 increments x to 11, then P1 sets x to (\* x x)
- 100: P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P1 sets x
